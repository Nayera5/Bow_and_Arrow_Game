# Description
 Introducing the Bow and Arrow challenge, an exciting game that will put your accuracy, quickness,
 and strategic thinking to the test!
 Playing as an archer, your goal in this game is to use your bow and arrow to pop balloons.
 The game consists of different classes and objects, clarifying the usage of OOP.

- `Level One`:
15 red balloons aligned next to each other.
Pop each balloon to progress to the next level.
- `Level Two`:
15 random red balloons, including 3 tricky yellow balloons.
The yellow balloons have irregular speed and acceleration, providing an additional challenge.
